# Developer Portal Controller

Developer Portal APIs and Controllers for Kubernetes-based API management.

## Overview

The Developer Portal Controller provides Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for managing API products and API keys in a developer portal ecosystem. It integrates with Kuadrant and Gateway API to provide a complete API lifecycle management solution.

## Custom Resources

### APIProduct

The `APIProduct` resource represents an API offering in the developer portal. It references an HTTPRoute and can include documentation, contact information, and usage plans.

#### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIProduct

---

### APIKey

The `APIKey` resource represents a developer's request for API access. It includes information about the requester, the desired plan tier, and the use case.

#### Example

Before creating an APIKey, the consumer must create a Secret in their namespace containing the API key:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: toystore-apikey-secret
  namespace: consumer-namespace
type: Opaque
stringData:
  api_key: "your-api-key-value-here"
```

Then, create the APIKey resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIKey
metadata:
  name: toystore-apikey
  namespace: consumer-namespace
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: developer-portal-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
spec:
  apiProductRef:
    name: toystore-api
    namespace: api-owner-namespace
  secretRef:
    name: toystore-apikey-secret
  planTier: gold
  useCase: "Authentication key for our Toystore API integration"
  requestedBy:
    userId: user-12345
    email: developer@example.com
status:
  apiHostname: api.example.com

  # Rate limits from selected plan
  limits:
    daily: 1000
    monthly: 300000
    custom:
      - limit: 100
        window: 1m

  # Authentication scheme
  authScheme:
    credentials:
      authorizationHeader:
        prefix: "Bearer"
    authenticationSpec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          kuadrant.io/apikey: mobile-app-payment-key

  # Approval conditions
  # Lifecycle states:
  #   - Pending: No conditions (initial state after creation)
  #   - Approved: Approved condition with status "True"
  #   - Denied: Denied condition with status "True"
  #   - Failed: Failed condition with status "True"
  conditions:
    - type: Approved
      status: "True"
      reason: ApprovedByOwner
      message: APIKey has been approved for toystore integration
      lastTransitionTime: "2025-12-09T10:30:00Z"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking changes: The current `v1alpha1` API is in dev preview support mode, so breaking changes are acceptable.

#### APIKey Spec Fields

- `apiProductRef` (required): Reference to the APIProduct this APIKey belongs to
  - `name`: Name of the APIProduct
  - `namespace`: Namespace of the APIProduct (enables cross-namespace references)
- `secretRef` (required): Reference to the secret containing the API key
  - `name`: Name of the secret in the consumer's namespace
  - Consumer creates this secret before creating the APIKey
  - The secret must contain an `api_key` entry with the value of the API key
  - Controller reads the API key from this secret on approval
- `planTier` (required): Tier of the plan (e.g., "gold", "silver", "bronze", "premium", "basic")
- `useCase` (required): Description of how the API key will be used
- `requestedBy` (required): Information about the requester
  - `userId`: Identifier of the user requesting the API key
  - `email`: Email address of the user (validated with regex pattern)

#### APIKey Status Fields

- `apiHostname`: Hostname from the HTTPRoute
- `limits`: Rate limits for the plan
- `authScheme`: Authentication scheme from the AuthPolicy
- `conditions`: Latest observations of the APIKey's state
  - Lifecycle states based on conditions:
    - **Pending**: No approval/denial conditions (initial state)
    - **Approved**: `Approved` condition with status `"True"`
    - **Denied**: `Denied` condition with status `"True"`
    - **Failed**: `Failed` condition with status `"True"`

---

### APIKeyRequest

The `APIKeyRequest` resource is a **shadow resource** automatically created by the Developer Portal Controller in the API owner's namespace whenever a consumer creates an `APIKey`. This design enables namespace-based RBAC: API owners can list and review access requests for their API products without requiring cluster-wide permissions to view all APIKeys across all consumer namespaces.

**Key characteristics:**

- Created automatically by the controller (not by users)
- Lives in the API owner's namespace
- Contains request metadata (use case, requester info, plan tier)
- Does NOT contain the API key secret value (preserves consumer data isolation)
- Serves as the basis for approval/denial decisions

#### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIKeyRequest
metadata:
  name: toystore-request-12345
  namespace: api-owner-namespace  # Owner's namespace
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: developer-portal-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
spec:
  # Reference to APIProduct in owner's namespace
  apiProductRef:
    name: toystore-api
  
  # Plan and use case details from consumer's request
  planTier: gold
  useCase: "Authentication key for our mobile app integration with Toystore API"
  
  # Information about who requested access
  requestedBy:
    userId: user-12345
    email: developer@example.com
  
  # Cross-namespace reference to the consumer's APIKey
  apiKeyRef:
    name: toystore-apikey
    namespace: consumer-namespace
status:
  conditions:
    - type: Pending
      status: "True"
      reason: AwaitingApproval
      message: Waiting for API owner to review the request
      lastTransitionTime: "2026-04-10T10:00:00Z"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking changes: The current `v1alpha1` API is in dev preview support mode, so breaking changes are acceptable.

#### APIKeyRequest Spec Fields

- `apiProductRef` (required): Reference to the APIProduct in the owner's namespace
  - `name`: Name of the APIProduct
- `planTier` (required): Tier of the plan (e.g., "gold", "silver", "bronze")
- `useCase` (required): Description of how the API key will be used
- `requestedBy` (required): Information about the requester
  - `userId`: Identifier of the user requesting the API key
  - `email`: Email address of the user
- `apiKeyRef` (required): Cross-namespace reference to the consumer's APIKey
  - `name`: Name of the APIKey in the consumer's namespace
  - `namespace`: Namespace where the APIKey was created

#### APIKeyRequest Status Fields

- `conditions`: Latest observations of the APIKeyRequest's state
  - **Pending**: Request is awaiting review
  - **Approved**: Request has been approved
  - **Denied**: Request has been denied

---

### APIKeyApproval

The `APIKeyApproval` resource represents an API owner's decision to approve or deny an `APIKeyRequest`. API owners create this resource in their own namespace to review and make decisions on API access requests for their API products.

**Key characteristics:**

- Created by API owners (manual approval mode) or automatically (automatic mode)
- Lives in the API owner's namespace (same as the APIProduct)
- Contains approval decision and reviewer metadata
- Controller validates that the APIKeyApproval namespace matches the APIProduct namespace to prevent cross-namespace approval attacks

#### Example: Approval

```yaml
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIKeyApproval
metadata:
  name: toystore-approval-12345
  namespace: api-owner-namespace
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: developer-portal-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
spec:
  # Reference to the APIKeyRequest being reviewed
  apiKeyRequestRef:
    name: toystore-request-12345
  
  # Approval decision
  approved: true
  
  # Reviewer information
  reviewedBy: api-owner@example.com
  reviewedAt: "2026-04-10T12:00:00Z"
  
  # Optional context for the decision
  reason: "Approved"
  message: "The use case is valid and meets our API usage guidelines. Approved for production use with gold tier access."
```

#### Example: Denial

```yaml
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIKeyApproval
metadata:
  name: toystore-approval-67890
  namespace: api-owner-namespace
spec:
  apiKeyRequestRef:
    name: toystore-request-67890
  
  approved: false
  reviewedBy: api-owner@example.com
  reviewedAt: "2026-04-10T14:30:00Z"
  reason: "InvalidUseCase"
  message: "The requested use case does not align with our API terms of service. Please contact support at api-support@example.com for more information."
```

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking changes: The current `v1alpha1` API is in dev preview support mode, so breaking changes are acceptable.

#### APIKeyApproval Spec Fields

- `apiKeyRequestRef` (required): Reference to the APIKeyRequest being reviewed
  - `name`: Name of the APIKeyRequest (same namespace only)
- `approved` (required): Boolean indicating whether the request is approved (`true`) or denied (`false`)
- `reviewedBy` (required): Identifier of the person who reviewed the request (e.g., email, username)
- `reviewedAt` (required): Timestamp when the request was reviewed (RFC3339 format)
- `reason` (optional): Short reason for the decision (e.g., "Approved", "Denied", "InvalidUseCase")
- `message` (optional): Additional context or explanation for the approval or denial decision

## Entity Relationship Model

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between resources across namespace boundaries:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph ConsumerNamespace["Consumer Namespace"]
        APIKey["APIKey"]
    end

    subgraph OwnerNamespace["API Owner Namespace"]
        APIProduct["APIProduct"]
        APIKeyRequest["APIKeyRequest<br/>(Shadow Resource)"]
        APIKeyApproval["APIKeyApproval"]
    end

    %% Cross-namespace references
    APIKey -->|"spec.apiProductRef<br/>(cross-namespace)"| APIProduct
    APIKeyRequest -->|"spec.apiKeyRef<br/>(cross-namespace)"| APIKey

    %% Same-namespace references
    APIKeyRequest -->|"spec.apiProductRef<br/>(local)"| APIProduct
    APIKeyApproval -->|"spec.apiKeyRequestRef<br/>(local)"| APIKeyRequest

    %% Controller actions

    classDef consumerNS fill:#e1f5ff,stroke:#0077cc,stroke-width:2px
    classDef ownerNS fill:#fff4e6,stroke:#ff9800,stroke-width:2px
    classDef shadowResource fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#9c27b0,stroke-width:2px

    class APIKey consumerNS
    class APIProduct,APIKeyApproval ownerNS
    class APIKeyRequest shadowResource
```

**Key Concepts:**

- **Namespace Isolation**: Consumer resources (APIKey) are isolated in the consumer's namespace; owner resources (APIProduct, APIKeyRequest, APIKeyApproval) are in the owner's namespace
- **Cross-Namespace References** (solid arrows): Enable consumers to request access to APIs owned by others
- **Local References** (solid arrows): Keep owner-side resources scoped within the owner's namespace
- **Controller Actions** (dashed arrows): Automated creation and updates by the Developer Portal Controller
- **Shadow Resource Pattern**: APIKeyRequest mirrors APIKey metadata in the owner's namespace without exposing sensitive data

---

## RBAC-Based Workflow

The Developer Portal Controller implements a namespace-based RBAC model with three personas:

### Workflow: Manual Approval Mode

1. **Consumer (API Consumer namespace)**
   - Creates an `APIKey` resource in their namespace
   - Specifies the desired API product, plan tier, and use case
   - APIKey starts in **Pending** state (no approval conditions)

2. **Controller (Automatic)**
   - Detects the new APIKey
   - Creates an `APIKeyRequest` shadow resource in the **API Owner's namespace**
   - Copies request metadata (use case, requester, plan tier) but NOT the API key value

3. **API Owner (API Owner namespace)**
   - Lists `APIKeyRequest` resources in their namespace
   - Reviews requests for their API products
   - Creates an `APIKeyApproval` resource with their decision
   - Controller validates that the approval namespace matches the APIProduct namespace

4. **Controller (Automatic)**
   - Processes the `APIKeyApproval` decision
   - Updates the consumer's `APIKey` conditions (Approved/Denied)
   - If approved: Creates the API key secret in the kuadrant namespace
   - Projects the API key value to `status.apiKeyValue` in the consumer's APIKey resource

5. **Consumer (API Consumer namespace)**
   - Checks their `APIKey` status for approval
   - Accesses the API key value from `status.apiKeyValue` (no secret read permissions needed)
   - Uses the API key to authenticate API requests

### Workflow: Automatic Approval Mode

If the APIProduct has `approvalMode: automatic`, the controller automatically creates an `APIKeyApproval` resource with `approved: true` when the `APIKeyRequest` is created, skipping the manual review step.

---

## Development Environment Setup

The `make local-setup` command sets up a complete local development environment using Kind (Kubernetes in Docker). This is useful for local development when you don't have Istio or Kuadrant controllers installed.

### What `make local-setup` Does

Running `make local-setup` performs the following steps:

1. **Creates a Kind cluster**
   - Deletes any existing `devportal-controller-local` Kind cluster
   - Creates a fresh Kind cluster with the name `devportal-controller-local`
   - Uses configuration from `utils/kind-cluster.yaml`

2. **Installs API dependencies (CRDs)**
   - Installs Developer Portal Controller CRDs (APIProduct, APIKey, APIKeyRequest, APIKeyApproval)
   - Installs Gateway API CRDs (HTTPRoute, Gateway, etc.)
   - Installs Kuadrant core CRDs (PlanPolicy, AuthPolicy)

3. **Installs demo resources**
   - Applies demo manifests from `utils/demo/gamestore.yaml`
   - Provides sample resources for testing and development

4. **Builds and deploys the controller**
   - Builds the controller Docker image from current code
   - Loads the image into the Kind cluster
   - Deploys the controller to the `developer-portal-controller-system` namespace
   - Waits for the deployment to become available

### Usage

```bash
# Set up the complete local development environment
make local-setup
```

### Individual Setup Steps

You can also run individual steps separately:

```bash
# Create only the Kind cluster with CRDs
make local-cluster-setup

# Add demo resources to an existing cluster
make demo-install

# Deploy controller from current code to an existing cluster
make local-deploy
```

## Usage

### Creating an APIProduct (API Owner)

1. Create an HTTPRoute for your API in your namespace
2. Create a PlanPolicy to define rate limits and tiers for the HTTPRoute
3. Create an APIProduct referencing the HTTPRoute
4. Set `approvalMode` to `manual` or `automatic` based on your approval requirements

### Requesting API Access (API Consumer)

1. **Create an APIKey** resource in your namespace referencing the API owner's APIProduct
   - Use a cross-namespace reference: `spec.apiProductRef.namespace`
   - Specify your desired plan tier and use case
   - Provide your user ID and email

2. **Wait for Review** (if `approvalMode` is `manual`)
   - Controller automatically creates an `APIKeyRequest` in the API owner's namespace
   - API owner reviews your request and creates an `APIKeyApproval` resource
   - Check your `APIKey` status conditions for approval/denial

3. **Access Your API Key**
   - Once approved, retrieve the API key value from `status.apiKeyValue`
   - No secret read permissions needed
   - Use the key to authenticate your API requests

### Reviewing Requests (API Owner)

1. **List Requests** for your API products
   - View `APIKeyRequest` resources in your namespace
   - Each request contains consumer's use case and requester information

2. **Make a Decision**
   - Create an `APIKeyApproval` resource with your decision
   - Set `approved: true` (approve) or `approved: false` (deny)
   - Provide reviewer info and optional reason/message

3. **Track Approvals**
   - List `APIKeyApproval` resources to see all decisions
   - Controller automatically updates the consumer's `APIKey` status

## kubectl Commands

```bash
# List APIProducts
kubectl get apiproducts

# List APIKeys (shortname: apik)
kubectl get apik

# View APIKey details with approval status
kubectl get apik -o wide

# Describe an APIKey to see status details
kubectl describe apikey toystore-apikey

# List APIKeyRequests (API owner view)
kubectl get apikeyrequests -n api-owner-namespace

# Describe an APIKeyRequest to review details
kubectl describe apikeyrequest toystore-request-12345 -n api-owner-namespace

# List APIKeyApprovals (API owner view)
kubectl get apikeyapprovals -n api-owner-namespace

# Describe an APIKeyApproval to see the decision
kubectl describe apikeyapproval toystore-approval-12345 -n api-owner-namespace
```

### Example: API Owner Reviewing Requests

```bash
# As an API owner, list all pending requests for your API products
kubectl get apikeyrequests -n my-api-namespace

# Review a specific request
kubectl describe apikeyrequest request-12345 -n my-api-namespace

# Approve the request by creating an APIKeyApproval
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIKeyApproval
metadata:
  name: approval-12345
  namespace: my-api-namespace
spec:
  apiKeyRequestRef:
    name: request-12345
  approved: true
  reviewedBy: owner@example.com
  reviewedAt: "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  reason: "Approved"
  message: "Use case is valid"
EOF
