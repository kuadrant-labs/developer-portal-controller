# Developer Portal Controller

Developer Portal APIs and Controllers for Kubernetes-based API management.

## Overview

The Developer Portal Controller provides Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for managing API products and API keys in a developer portal ecosystem. It integrates with Kuadrant and Gateway API to provide a complete API lifecycle management solution.

## Custom Resources

### APIProduct

The `APIProduct` resource represents an API offering in the developer portal. It references an HTTPRoute and can include documentation, contact information, and usage plans.

#### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIProduct

  name: toystore-api
  namespace: default

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking changes: The current `v1alpha1` API is in dev preview support mode, so breaking changes are acceptable.

#### APIProduct Spec Fields

- `displayName` (required): Human-readable name for the API product
- `description`: Detailed description of the API product
- `version`: API version (e.g., v1, v2)
- `approvalMode`: Whether access requests are auto-approved (`automatic`) or require manual review (`manual`)
- `publishStatus`: Controls visibility in the catalog (`Draft` or `Published`)
- `tags`: List of tags for categorization and search
- `targetRef`: Reference to the HTTPRoute that this API product represents
- `documentation`: API documentation links (OpenAPI spec, Swagger UI, docs URL, git repository, techdocs)
- `contact`: Contact information for API owners (team, email, Slack, URL)

#### APIProduct Status Fields

- `observedGeneration`: Generation of the most recently observed spec
- `discoveredPlans`: List of plan policies discovered from the HTTPRoute
- `openapi`: OpenAPI specification fetched from the API with sync timestamp
- `conditions`: Current state conditions (Ready, PlanPolicyDiscovered)

---

### APIKey

The `APIKey` resource represents a developer's request for API access. It includes information about the requester, the desired plan tier, and the use case.

#### Example

Before creating an APIKey, the consumer must create a Secret in their namespace containing the API key:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: toystore-apikey-secret
  namespace: consumer-namespace
type: Opaque
stringData:
  api_key: "your-api-key-value-here"
```

Then, create the APIKey resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIKey
metadata:
  name: toystore-apikey
  namespace: consumer-namespace
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: developer-portal-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
spec:
  apiProductRef:
    name: toystore-api
    namespace: api-owner-namespace
  secretRef:
    name: toystore-apikey-secret
  planTier: gold
  useCase: "Authentication key for our Toystore API integration"
  requestedBy:
    userId: user-12345
    email: developer@example.com
status:
  apiHostname: api.example.com

  # Rate limits from selected plan
  limits:
    daily: 1000
    monthly: 300000
    custom:
      - limit: 100
        window: 1m

  # Authentication scheme
  authScheme:
    credentials:
      authorizationHeader:
        prefix: "Bearer"
    authenticationSpec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          kuadrant.io/apikey: mobile-app-payment-key

  # Approval conditions
  # Lifecycle states:
  #   - Pending: No conditions (initial state after creation)
  #   - Approved: Approved condition with status "True"
  #   - Denied: Denied condition with status "True"
  #   - Failed: Failed condition with status "True"
  conditions:
    - type: Approved
      status: "True"
      reason: ApprovedByOwner
      message: APIKey has been approved for toystore integration
      lastTransitionTime: "2025-12-09T10:30:00Z"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking changes: The current `v1alpha1` API is in dev preview support mode, so breaking changes are acceptable.

#### APIKey Spec Fields

- `apiProductRef` (required): Reference to the APIProduct this APIKey belongs to
  - `name`: Name of the APIProduct
  - `namespace`: Namespace of the APIProduct (enables cross-namespace references)
- `secretRef` (required): Reference to the secret containing the API key
  - `name`: Name of the secret in the consumer's namespace
  - Consumer creates this secret before creating the APIKey
  - The secret must contain an `api_key` entry with the value of the API key
  - Controller reads the API key from this secret on approval
- `planTier` (required): Tier of the plan (e.g., "gold", "silver", "bronze", "premium", "basic")
- `useCase` (required): Description of how the API key will be used
- `requestedBy` (required): Information about the requester
  - `userId`: Identifier of the user requesting the API key
  - `email`: Email address of the user (validated with regex pattern)

#### APIKey Status Fields

- `apiHostname`: Hostname from the HTTPRoute
- `limits`: Rate limits for the plan
- `authScheme`: Authentication scheme from the AuthPolicy
- `conditions`: Latest observations of the APIKey's state
  - Lifecycle states based on conditions:
    - **Pending**: No approval/denial conditions (initial state)
    - **Approved**: `Approved` condition with status `"True"`
    - **Denied**: `Denied` condition with status `"True"`
    - **Failed**: `Failed` condition with status `"True"`

## Development environment setup

Dev env

```bash
make kind-create-cluster
make install
make gateway-api-install
make kuadrant-core-install
```

Deploy controller

```bash
make local-deploy
```

## Usage

### Creating an APIProduct

1. Create an HTTPRoute for your API
2. Create a PlanPolicy to define rate limits and tiers
3. Create an APIProduct referencing the HTTPRoute

### Requesting an APIKey

1. Create an APIKey resource referencing the APIProduct
2. If `approvalMode` is `manual`, wait for approval
3. Once approved, the secret will be created with the API key
4. Use the key from the secret to authenticate API requests

## kubectl Commands

```bash
# List APIProducts
kubectl get apiproducts

# List APIKeys (shortname: apik)
kubectl get apik

# View APIKey details with phase and plan
kubectl get apik -o wide

# Describe an APIKey to see status details
kubectl describe apikey toystore-apikey
```
